# Deep-Learning-Projects
This repository contains **different sets of deep learning projects**, each organized in its own folder.

- ðŸ“„ **.ipynb files** â€“ Jupyter Notebook files implementing deep learning methods such as:
  - **ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)**
  - **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**
  - **Real-time Object Detection using OpenCV**
  
- ðŸ“‚ **.csv files** â€“ Dataset files used for training, validation, and testing in some of the projects.

Each folder is an **independent project**, demonstrating various deep learning techniques and workflows, from building and training models to applying them on datasets or real-time inputs through OpenCV.
